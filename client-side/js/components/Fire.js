        <p class="fire-text">One of the most important skills to have when you are braving the wilderness is knowing how to build a fire.
    It is also important to know how to safely build this fire and how to tend to it so that you do not accidentally 
   start a wildfire. It is important that you know how to build a fire in the wilderness so that you can keep yourself
    warm at all times. This lowers your risk of catching hypothermia, contracting frostbite, and even contracting an 
   illness.There is always the possibility that temperatures might drop or that it could rain, at which point you will
    most likely be seeking a source of warmth. The skill of knowing how to build a fire will keep you warm and safe, 
   as well as those around you.</p>

    <h2 class = "firestarter-title">Find your firestarter</h2>
    <img class="fire-pics" src='${fireTipsPic}' alt = "pic of a campfire">
        <p class="fire-text">A good fire begins with a quality firestarter. In some cases, that can mean something as simple as a store-bought 
    starter or lighter fluid-doused twigs. But if you ever find yourself with no access to such tools, there are plenty 
    of other options you can use to get some flames burning. A favorite is birch bark and you can pack a bag or two 
    of the stuff before heading into the wilderness. It contains a natural oil that is water-resistant, so it will 
    catch fire even if it is wet.  If you’re harvesting bark in the backcountry, try to find some that has been blown 
    off of trees. Each piece has many layers, so keep peeling until you find a dry one.</p>
    
        <p class="fire-text">Spruce sap also makes a great natural firestarter. The flammable substance oozes out of injured trees and hardens 
    into a resin, which can be snapped off and set ablaze. It may take several matches to get going but once lit,
    the sap will burn for several minutes, making it a great resource in wet conditions. While spruce is best, any 
    hardened sap will do. Just find a blob that’s about the size of a wad of chewing gum, pull it off the tree, place 
    it on the end of a stick, and light it up.</p>
    
        <p class="fire-text">Other substances that make admirable stand-ins for natural firestarters include cotton balls coated in petroleum 
    jelly, hand sanitizer sprinkled on small kindling, such as dry leaves and grass, or the fibrous inside of the 
    bark of cedar trees. You can also make your own fire starters by melting candle wax, adding dryer lint, and
     coating a pine cone or two with the mixture. And for a fun way to start a fire and impress your friends, you can
     use Doritos, Cheetos, or any type of oily chip in a pinch. Simply light a corner of a few chips and place them 
    beneath your kindling.</p>

    <div class="fire-breathe-container">
    <h2 class = "fire-breathe-title">Give your fire room to breathe</h2>
    <img class="fire-pics" src = '${fireBuilding}' alt = "pic of building a fire">
        <p class="fire-text">You need oxygen, fuel, and a sustained ignition source to have a fire. These three factors form a "fire triangle". 
    If you neglect one of these things, your triangle will collapse. Usually, fuel means wood and an ignition
    source is a match or lighter. The level of oxygen will depend on how the wood is arranged—if you stack it well, it
    will facilitate air movement so the fire can breathe and grow.</p>
    
        <p class="fire-text">Start with the kindling. You can dig a trench a couple of inches deep as your fire pit, then lay three small pieces
     of wood over the trench in a triangle that’s just big enough to support your tinder. Pile your tinder, place your 
    firestarter of choice in the middle of it, and build your structure around it all. Start with smaller branches and 
    sticks that will catch easily, then add larger pieces as the fire grows. Be careful not to overcrowd the wood, or
    oxygen won’t be able to flow freely and your fire will go out. Stick with branches or logs no bigger than your wrist.
    Larger logs don’t mean more heat energy, just a longer burn. And don’t worry if you can’t build a massive blaze—small 
    fires are just as effective for cooking and heating as larger ones.</p>

    <div class="fire-rain-container">
    <h2 class = "fire-rain-title">Setting a fire in the rain</h2>
    <img class="fire-pics" src='${fireRainPic}' alt = "pic of a campfire in the rain">
        <p class="fire-text">Building a fire when everything’s perfectly dry is one thing, but in cold and wet conditions it becomes exponentially 
    more difficult. It can, however, still be done. Start by looking for dry wood and kindling at the bases of trees 
    where branches and foliage may have protected it from rain. In an emergency, you can harvest small branches from 
    the lowest parts of nearby trees. Sometimes you have to do what’s necessary to survive. Look for dead trees or 
    branches and wood that’s fallen to the ground that might be soggy on the outside, but dry on the inside. When you
    do, carve off the wet outer layers until you hit dry wood.</p>
    
        <p class="fire-text">Find a sheltered location that will help you stay dry and warm, like against a rock face or in a grove of trees. 
    In gusty weather, dig a pit for your fire to sit in—the stronger the wind, the deeper your pit should be. Collect
    more wood than you think you need—you don’t want to have to leave your fire. Make your fire structure no more 
    than shin-high to conserve fuel, and store wet wood near your flames to dry it out. Make a solid base. You want to 
    get the fire structure off of the wet surface. Lay down a raft-like foundation of wrist size sticks. </p>

    <h1 class= "fire-methods-title">Methods for starting a fire:</h1>

    <div class="fire-drill-container">
    <h2 class = "hand-drill-title">The Hand Drill</h2>
    <img class="fire-pics" src='${fireHandDrill}' alt = "pic of a someone starting a fire">
    <p class="fire-text">If you’re wondering how to start a fire with sticks, you’ll want to try the hand drill. The hand drill strategy is a 
    primitive method and the hardest to do. Shaft revolution and descending weight are two of the most imperative prerequisites 
    for starting a hand drill fire. This method will require wood, resolute hands, and gritty determination.</p>
    
    <ul class = "hand-drill-method-list">
        <li>• Make a tinder nest. The tinder nest is necessary to get the fire going. A tinder nest can be made from things
        that bursts into flames effectively, such as to dry leaves, grass, and bark. For more hints on how to pick out the best 
        wood, check out our campfire tips and tricks.</li>
        <li>• Make your notch. Cut an angular notch on your fireboard and create a depression near it.</li>
        <li>• Place bark below the v-shaped cut. The bark is used to get an ember from the erosion between the axle and fireboard.</li>
        <li>• Start spinning. Place the shaft into the groove on your fireboard. Your shaft ought to be around two feet to work well.
        Keep up weight on the fireboard and start to roll the shaft in your hands rapidly down the axle. Continue doing this until
        an ember lights on the fireboard.</li>
        <li>• Start a fire. When you see a shining ember, tap the fireboard to place your ember onto the bit of bark. Exchange the bark 
        to your nest of tinder. Slowly blow it to get yourself fire.</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    

    <div class="fire-plow-container">
    <h2 class = "fire-plow-title">The Fire Plow</h2>
    <img class="fire-pics" src='${firePlow}' alt = "pic of a someone starting a fire by plow method">
    <p class="fire-text">The fire plow is another common method using minimal tools. All you’ll need is a softer wood for the plow board and a harder wood
    for the plow. Willow and poplar make good plow board material.</p>
    
     <ol class = "fire-plow-list">
     <li>• Set up your fireplace and cut a groove about one inch wide and six to eight inches long down a board. Find a piece of hardwood 
     about one foot long and carve it to a point at the end.</li>
     <li>• Rub. Take the head of your plow and place it on your fireboard. Begin rubbing the tip of the plow back and forth in the grove.
      This will create small pits of dust.</li>
      <li>• Raise the board. Raise the top of the board and rest it on your knee, so that the dust collects at the bottom.</li>
      <li>• Intensify the motion. Once a small pile of dust has collected at the bottom, rub the plow quickly and with force in the groove
       until the dust smolders.</li>
    <li>• Transfer the flame to the tinder. Once the dust is alight, transfer it to the tinder and gently blow to start your fire. </li>
     </ol>
     </div>

    <div class="fire-bow-container">
     <h2 class = "fire-bow-drill-title">The Bow Drill</h2>
     <img class="fire-pics" src = '${fireBowDrill}' alt = "pic of a fire bow drill">
     <p class="fire-text">The bow drill is presumably the best contact-based technique to use because it’s less demanding to keep up the rate and weight
      required to create friction that can produce fire. However, it does require the most materials. 
      The items you’ll need for this method are: </p>

      <ul class = "fire-bow-drill-materials-list">
      <li>• Fireboard: A flat, softwood board about a foot long and at least six inches wide.</li>
      <li>• Socket: A hand-sized, flat rock with a depression on one side. This is used to put weight on the top of the drill as you’re 
      turning it with the bow.</li>
      <li>• Drill: No, not a power drill! We’re talking a sturdy hardwood stick between one and two inches in diameter and about a foot long.</li>
      <li>• Bow: A sturdy, yet flexible green stick about two feet long and one inch in diameter.</li>
      <li>• Cord: If you don’t have any paracord handy, hiking boot laces make a great cord.</li>
      </ul>
    <p class="fire-text">Once you’ve gathered your materials, follow these steps to start the fire.</p>

    <ul class = "fire-bow-drill-list">
    <li>• Make your bow: The bow ought to be about the length of your arm. Bend the bow into a half-moon shape and tie it 
    into position with the cord.</li>
    <li>• Set up the fireboard. Cut a shallow depression on the center edge of the fireboard. On the underside of the board, 
    notch a V-shaped cut that meets the depression on top.</li>
    <li>• String up the drill. Circle the bowstring around the drill. Place the drill on the fireboard then apply some
     pressure on the other side with your socket.</li>
     <li>• Start sawing. Using your bow, move the drill by doing a sawing motion. The drill should pivot rapidly. Continue 
     sawing until you make an ember.</li>
     <li>• Start a fire. Put ember into the nest and slowly blow on it to get yourself fire.</li>
    </ul>

    <img class="fire-pics" src = '${fireStoneSteel}' alt = "pic of starting a fire with stone and steel">
        <p class="fire-text">Here’s how to start a fire without matches, lighters, or sticks! Using a flint is a traditional standby and is presumably
    a standout amongst the most solid and simple approaches to start an open-air fire. You might even see folks using this to start
    a fire at an ordinary campground. It’s generally a smart idea to carry a steel and flint with you on an outdoors trip. It is 
    utilized by various armed forces the world over.</p>

      <ol class = "fire-stone-list">
      <li>• Make a tinder nest. This nest will be used to catch the spark that you make with the flint and steel.</li>
      <li>• Grab your starters. Grip the steel in one hand while taking the striker in the other.</li>
      <li>• Strike. Position the fire steel against your base to keep it from moving. At that point push the striker down 
      the length of the fire steel in one smooth movement.</li>
      <li>• Start a fire! Place the ember in the nest and slowly blow it to get yourself a fire.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 class = "fire-batteries-title">Batteries and Steel Wool</h2>
      <img class="fire-pics" src = '${fireBattery}' alt = "pic of starting a fire with a battery">
      <p class="fire-text">With this strategy, all you need are a few batteries and steel wool.</p>

      <ol class = "fire-battery-list">
      <li>• Stretch out the wool. You need it to be around 6 inches in length and at least an inch wide.</li>
      <li>• Rub the battery on the steel wool. You can use any battery; however 9-volt batteries are recommended.
       Rub the battery sides with the steel. The wool will start to gleam and blaze.</li>
       <li>• Place the blazing wool on the tinder nest and slowly blow it to get a larger fire.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 class = "fire-lenses-title">Traditional Lenses</h2>
      <img class="fire-pics" src = '${fireLense}' alt = "pic of starting a fire with a lense">
      <p class="fire-text">With this approach, all you need is some kind lens to center daylight on a particular spot. A magnifying glass or
      binocular lens both work.</p>

      <ol class = "fire-lenses-list">
      <li>• Get your tinder ready.</li>
      <li>• Hold the magnifying glass between the sun and the tinder. Look for the bright dot that appears. Tilt the
       magnifying glass so that the dot is over the tinder and about a quarter-inch in diameter.</li>
       <li>• Focus the dot for 30 seconds to a minute. As with other methods of fire starting, patience is key! Once the
        tinder starts smoking, gently blow to get the flame going.</li>
