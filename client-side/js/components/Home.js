  <p>Founded in 2021 by a group of wild and crazy individuals for a 
  tremendous love for the great outdoors and the many adventures

  friends, family, and co-workers on the survivor skills that they 
  had experienced over their many years.  And due to the number of 
  requests for survival guiding, <strong>Wilderness Wilds</strong> was born.</p>
