        <p class="water-text">In any survival scenario, water is by far your most important resource. You can easily go a day without food,
    and usually don’t need shelter right away, unless you’re in freezing conditions. Not having any water for 24 hours,
    however, while survivable, depletes both your physical and mental strength, making it more difficult to perform the 
    tasks necessary to making it out the other side. And after just three days without hydration, your body will shut 
    down, and it’ll be lights out for you. What’s best for you depends on the microbes you expect to encounter, 
    how light you want to travel and the volume of water you will treat.</p>

    <ul class = "water-treating-list">
    <li>• Use a cotton cloth or coffee filter to strain out sediment before you filter/purify.</li>
    <li>• Greenish water contains algae that harbor microorganisms. Algae can clog water filters and reduce the effectiveness of chemicals.</li>
    <li>• Brownish water contains organic tree tannins that are typically safe to drink.</li>
    <li>• Beavers are the favored host of Giardia. Don’t take water from beaver streams or near beaver lodges.</li>
    <li>• Don’t draw water from shallows or near campsites.</li>
    <li>• Avoid clear water that’s tumbling over sunny rocks. While UV light does kill microbes, moving water mixes 
    them and increases the chance they’ll get into your water sample.</li>
    <li>• Take water from near the surface of a calm, sunlit pool. Harmful organisms tend to lurk just out of reach of sunlight.</li>

    <h2 class = "water-tips-title-2">Lakes, Streams, and Rivers</h2>
    <img class ="water-pics" src = '${waterRivers}' alt="pic of a river">
        <p class="water-text">These are your most obvious sources of water in the wild. Clear, flowing water is your best option, as the movement doesn’t 
    allow bacteria to fester. This means that small streams should be what you look for first. Rivers are acceptable, but larger
    ones often have a lot of pollution from upstream. Lakes and ponds are okay, but they’re stagnant, meaning there’s an increased
    chance for bacteria.</p>
        <p class="water-text">Now then, how do you go about finding these bodies of water? First, use your senses. If you stand perfectly still and listen 
    intently, you may be able to hear running water, even if it’s a great distance away. Next you’ll use your eyes to try and find animal
    tracks, which could lead to water. Insect swarms, while annoying, are another sign of water close by. And in the mornings and evenings 
    especially, following the flight path of birds may lead you to your much-needed H2O. Watching animal behavior is especially important
    in the desert. Animal tracks will be easier to spot in the sand, and they’ll almost always eventually lead to water. Birds will also 
    especially flock towards water in dry areas. Also just scout the environment you’re in. Water runs downhill, so follow valleys, ditches,
    gullies, etc. Find your way to low ground, and you’ll often run into water.</p>

    <div class="water-boiling-container">
    <h2 class = "water-boiling-title">Boiling</h2>
    <img class ="water-pics" src ='${waterBoiling}' alt = "pic of boiling water by a fire">
        <p class="water-text">Boiling water is one of the best wilderness water purification methods. Boiling clear water is the most efficient way to make it 
    safe to drink. Most bacteria and microorganisms can’t survive in boiling water, and they will likely die off during the heating process.</p>
        <p class="water-text">Only boil clear water. If you boil water contaminated with physical materials like dirt and leaves, you could still end up getting sick 
    from the heavy minerals that will seep into your water. Even stagnant water from lakes can be boiled and purified.</p>
        <p class="water-text">With a solid container and a decent fire, you could have purified water in as little as 10 minutes. Just make sure that you let the water
    bubble for at least five minutes before you remove it from the fire. Once your water has been thoroughly boiled, let it rest for another five
    minutes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="water-distillation-container">
    <h2 class = "water-distillation-title">Distillation</h2>
    <img class ="water-pics" src ='${waterDistillationPic}' alt = "pic of pouring water by a fire">
        <p class="water-text">This method of purifying water in the wild is particularly useful in tropical settings or Pacific regions. Often, when you find fresh water
    in a tropical setting, it may contain high levels of sodium and minerals. Drinking this water may cause you to become even more dehydrated
    if you aren’t careful.</p>
        <p class="water-text">One way to separate the water from its salts and minerals is to distill it. However, this process requires some items that might not be
    accessible in the wild. For the distillation process to work, you will need some type of container, a smaller container, and a cover. If 
    you need a portable way to distill water in the wild, you'll need a way to boil it, trap the vapor (steam), and cool it so it condenses
    back into liquid. It's possible to do this with two glass bottles, or with a pot, aluminum foil, and a glass jar.</p>
        <p class="water-text">By placing the smaller vessel inside the larger one and filling the larger one with salt water, you can cover it and let condensation 
    naturally separate the water for you. Just make sure that your cover is indented towards the smaller vessel so that the condensation collects 
    on the cover in a way that causes it to run down and drip into your smaller container.</p>
        <p class="water-text">With enough sunlight and the right gear, you can easily gather all of the drinkable water you need to survive. While this process doesn’t 
    fully purify your water, it distills it. This water can then be filtered using an emergency water filter.</p>

    <div class="water-rain-container">
    <h2 class = "collect-rainwater-title">Collect Rainwater</h2>
    <img class ="water-pics" class ="rain-water-pic" src= '${rainWater}' alt="pic of rain water">
    <p class="water-text">There are two primary methods of collecting rainwater. The first is to use any and all containers you might have on you. The second is to 
    tie the corners of a poncho or tarp around trees a few feet off the ground, place a small rock in the center to create a depression, and let 
    the water collect.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="water-snow-container">
    <h2 class = "collect-snow-title">Collect Snow</h2>
    <img class ="water-pics" src= '${snowWater}' alt="pic of snow in the woods">
    <p class="water-text">Collect ice or snow and wrap it inside a t-shirt or large bandana. Use sturdy branches to suspend the snow above a fire. As the snow or ice 
    begins to melt it will start to drip through the fabric. Use a large cup or container to catch the falling water.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="water-tablets-container">
    <h2 class = "water-tablets-title">Water purification tablets/chemicals</h2>
    <img class ="water-pics" src= '${waterPurificationPic}' alt="pic of bucket of water">
    <p class="water-text">Water purification tablets are meant to be beneficial to anyone that does not have access to portable and clean water. These types of tablets 
    and chemicals include products like Aquatabs, Iodine, and Katadyn MicroPur MP1 Chlorine Dioxide Tablets. They have become a popular choice for 
    on-the-go disinfection thanks to their portability and simplicity: just filter cloudy/turbid water through a filter or cloth, drop a tablet 
    in 1-2 litres of water, wait 30 minutes and it’s safe to rehydrate. They work by releasing free chlorine into the water to quickly kill most 
    pathogens, similar to how many municipal water treatment plants disinfect drinking water before releasing it into the distribution system.</p>
