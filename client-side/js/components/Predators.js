    <h1 class ="predators-summary-title"><h1>What is a Predator?</h1>
      <p class="predator-text-container">Predators are wild animals that hunt, or prey on, other animals. All animals need food to live. 
    Predator animals need the flesh of the animals that they kill to survive. Weasels, hawks, wolves, mountain lions, 
    and grizzly bears are all predators. Predators are carnivores, which means their diet consists of meat. Some predators, 
    such as coyotes and bears, are also scavengers, meaning they will eat the carcasses of animals that they didn't hunt themselves.</p>
      <p class="predator-text-container">Dangerous animals are not the only concern when out in the wild. There are various other creatures that can harm or even kill you. 
    In this article we will discuss not only animals, but also harmful creatures within these regions. This of course is not a complete list, 
    but these are some of the most common creature within the regions displayed below.</p>

    by raising your arms and opening your jacket. Bang sticks together and speak firmly in a LOUD voice. If the mountain
    lion moves toward you start throwing things at it without bending down or turning your back on it. Use bear spray if
    you have it.</p>

    <p class="predator-text">This species prefers living in quiet, dark locations. It typically builds its web outside, in 
    gardens or beneath rocks. Most bites occur starting in August and September when males are out of their hiding places 
    seeking females with which to mate. It is believed that up to one half of the bites by hobo spiders are ‘dry bites’ 
    meaning that no venom is secreted.</p>

        and deciduous forests, as well as open alpine habitats. Stand and face the bear directly. Never run away from or 
        approach him. Make yourself look as big as possible by spreading your arms or, better yet, a coat. Make as much noise as possible 
        by yelling, banging pots and pans.</p>

    Do not run away. tay calm, make yourself as big as possible, and yell. Coyotes usually will not attack if you're a serious threat.
    Back away slowly and pick up your dog if you're able to. Use your flashlight if you can to scare the coyote away. Throw small stones, 
    sticks, tennis balls or anything else you can lay your hands on. Remember the intent is to scare and not to injure. Pets such as
    dogs and cats look like tasty treats to coyotes too.</p>

    <p class="predator-text">Avoid Hornet’s Nest:  Hornets' nest is a paper-like structure made from wood chewed by hornets. 
    Most nests are shaped in the form of a teardrop and contain one single entrance. Nests are predominantly aerial in nature 
    or in very protective locations. Hornet Stings can be dangerous, the main reason a hornet's sting is so deadly compared to 
    other stinging insects is due to the sheer size of a hornet. Generally, hornet venom isn't considered that toxic to humans, 
    but due to their size, the amount of venom they release per sting can be harmful.
